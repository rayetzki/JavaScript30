    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 20;
    let age2 = 22;
    age2 = age;
    console.assert('age', 'age2', age === age2); // true
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.assert('team is players', players === team);
    team[3]  = 'Illia';
    console.assert(team == players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Illia';
    console.log('team2 changed: ', players !== team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
  
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      address: {
        city: 'Kyiv',
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const other = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
  
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const other2 = { ...person };
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const other3 = structuredClone(person);
    console.log(other2, other3);
    console.log(person.address === other2.address);
